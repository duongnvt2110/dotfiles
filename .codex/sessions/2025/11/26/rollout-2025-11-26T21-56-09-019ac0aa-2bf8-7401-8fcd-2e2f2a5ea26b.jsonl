That’s why I take this test.\\n\\n1a) Your Work\\nGeneral Description of Your Job\\n\\n\\nWhat job (or, what work) do you do?\\nI’m a teacher at an English training center. I’ve been working there for\\nseveral years. It’s my pleasure to see my students make progress, so I think\\nthis job is very suitable for me.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the nature of that work?\\nIt’s a teaching job. I help the students improve their English language skills\\nand most of them are planning to take IELTS.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you do in that job?\\nI teach English, both productive and receptive skills. My job is to help my\\nstudents succeed in their studies and pass exams if they need to.\\n\\n\\n\\nWould you say your job (or, your work) is very important?\\n\\n、\\n\\nI think so. I think the world will be much worse if there’re no teachers,\\nespecially good ones. I think my job is very important to the society.\\n\\n\\nHow do you think your subject will help you (or, benefit you) in the future?\\nI’m planning to be a teacher. Now I major in TESOL, which can help me\\nlearn teaching skills and I’m sure in the future I’ll be a qualified teacher\\nbecause of my educational background. However, experience is also\\nimportant, so I can’t stop learning even after I start working.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you think this subject has good prospects for the future?\\nTeachers are always needed in our society, so I’m sure I’ll be able to find a\\nsuitable job when I graduate.\\n3\\n\\nVisit our face: IELTS speaking and writing Corner\\n\\n\\f\\n\\nWhat benefits can people have if they do the jobs they like?\\nWell, there're many benefits. If people enjoy the jobs they do, they can be\\nmore productive and are more likely to succeed. When they do the jobs, they\\nalso won’t feel too much pressure but can enjoy themselves. It’s good for\\ntheir mental health as well.\\nFinding a Job\\n\\n\\nHow did you get that job?\\nI searched online and saw the job post. There were many chances for me to\\nchoose, so I submitted my resume online and got the interview and\\neverything.\\n\\n\\n\\nWas it easy to get that job?\\nOf course, it’s not easy, but I tried my best and because of my past working\\nexperience and professional training, I got this job.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs it easy (for other people in your country) to find work doing your job?\\nIt depends. For some people, if they graduated from some prestigious\\nschools with good majors, they can find jobs easily. Nowadays, a lot of\\ncompanies also pay attention to experience. Enough relevant working\\nexperience can help a person to be more competitive.\\n\\nFeelings about the Job\\n\\n\\nDo you like (or, enjoy) your job (or, your work)?\\nYes, I do. It provides me the ways to achieve my goals and help other people\\nsucceed. I’m sure I can learn a lot from my job.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich do you enjoy more, communicating with people at work, or the work\\nitself?\\nI enjoy the work itself. I think good communication is also important, but it\\nseems not matter much in our daily life. How to work better, in my opinion,\\nwould be more significant for me because my main purpose is to work not to\\nhave unnecessary conversations.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich is more important to you, co‐operating with others at work, or the\\nwork itself?\\nI like working with others because we can all contribute our efforts and\\nmake our goal easier to achieve. If I work by myself, I can probably\\norganize my own time and work better, but I won’t get feedback and support\\nfrom others.\\n4\\n\\nVisit our face: IELTS speaking and writing Corner\\n\\n\\f5\\n\\n\\nWhich is more important to you, the work you do or your colleagues (the\\n\\n[... omitted 13834 of 14090 lines ...]\\n\\nhard to trust them. I\\nguess advertisements influence me a lot.\\n3. What kind of advertisement can be seen by more people?\\nI think it will be the ads on TV. Most people in China like watching TV while\\nthey are having dinner with their family. In addition, compared with ads on\\nnewspapers, advertisements on TV can give us a more vivid view and we can\\n\\nVisit our face: IELTS speaking and writing Corner\\n\\n\\f285\\n\\nhave a deeper impression, so people prefer ads on TV and they watch them\\nmore.\\n4. Where can you find ads outdoors?\\nMany places. At the bus stop and subway stations, you can always see big\\nscreens showing ads. Besides these, on buses, there’re tv sets to show ads and\\n\\nother programs all day long. Furthermore, ads are placed in big departments\\nstores as well.\\n5. Do you think there’re too many ads nowadays?\\nOf course. I think the ads on TV take a lot of our time so they always disturb\\nus when we watch a program. However, when we watch ads on buses, they\\ncan give us some color on our journey, so these ads might be good.\\n6. Are ads more likely to succeed if they have celebrities in them?\\nI think so. Because a lot of people like celebrities and they’d like to try the\\nproducts that celebrities advertise. This kind of advertisement is more trusted\\nand effective. However the cost of these advertisements should be expensive\\nand as consumers, we are actually paying for this.\\n7. Through what ways can people see advertisements?\\nPeople can be exposed to ads almost everywhere. When we watch TV, read\\nnewspapers, or surf the internet, we’ll always be surrounded by different ads.\\nEven when we ride the bus, there’ll be ads on the bus TV screens.\\n8. What kinds of advertisements attract people more?\\nPeople like creative advertisements. Some ads can be like stories and make us\\nfeel intrigued when we see them and we want to see them over and over again.\\nHowever, there’re also many boring ads that repeat the same thing over and\\nover again.\\n9. Why should advertisements have fashionably dressed people in them?\\nMost ads are giving us visual attractions. If we see fashionably dressed people,\\nwe’ll tend to think highly of their products. It’s not right but very common,\\npeople judge you from what you wear. The clothing shows status and taste.\\n10. Do you think over‐weighted or not good looking people might feel sad when\\nthey see only beautiful people are in ads?\\nI don’t think so. Everyone is willing to appreciate beauty no matter how ugly\\nlooking they are. Those over‐weighted or not good looking people, most of\\nthem, having an appropriate attitude about themselves and about the world,\\nand they know the beautiful people in ads are just to attract audience to\\npromote sales. In this sense, I don’t think they will be sad.\\n11. What kind of media is more favored by advertising companies?\\nAdvertisements, in essence, are to attract people eyes, to maximize the\\ninfluence of the brands, the products, and then promote sales. In this sense, I\\nthink the advertising companies may like those media that have a large loyal\\naudience, that have a positive fame, and that can focus on the expected\\ncustomers.\\n12. Will you be bothered by the posters on buildings?\\n\\nVisit our face: IELTS speaking and writing Corner\\n\\n\\f286\\n\\nSometimes. Usually, the posters on buildings will be to advertise some popular\\ngoods, with some beautiful looking people, and some attractive colors, so they\\nmay just attract me rather than annoy me. However, occasionally, when the\\nadvertisers hope to attract eyes in a special way, or leave a deep impression on\\n\\nthe viewers, the posters designed by them may be shocking or abrupt in front\\nof my eyes. In this sense, I am bothered to some extent.\\n13. What kind of advertisement can attract people more?\\nI think vivid advertisement can attract people more. If an advertisement is very\\nsimple, it may not attract people. But if an advertisement has a variety of\\ncolors and some vivid scenes, it will catch people’s eyes. Besides, I think if\\nthere is a famous star in an advertisement, it will certainly be helpful to attract\\npeople.\\n14. Should the advertisement indicate that certain products are harmful for\\npeople’s health, such as the cigarette?\\nI think so. Because even the advertisement is used for increase the profit of a\\nproduct, they need to point out the bad influence of the product. If a person\\nlikes to smoke, he or she may not care so much about the bad effect of\\ncigarette, so I don’t think they need to avoid the bad influence of a product.\\n15. Some people think advertisements can provide more choices for consumers\\nand others disagree, what’s your opinion?\\nI agree with the statement that advertisements can provide more choices for\\nconsumers. Without advertisements, we don’t even know the existence of\\nmany products, but advertisements make us known about those choices. For\\nexample, once I saw the advertisement of KFC, and I went there to taste new\\ndishes there.\\n16. Does China have laws concerning advertisements?\\nYes, I think so. Although I do not have much knowledge about the laws\\nconcerning advertisements, I think there are some laws to regulate the market\\nof advertisements. For example, the advertisements should not have\\ninformation about eroticism, violence, and so on.\\n17. Should the government supervise advertisements?\\nYes, I think so. I think it’s necessary because with supervision, it will not bring\\nbad influence on teenagers. For example, the advertisements should not have\\ninformation about eroticism, violence, and so on.\\n\\n25. A bird\\nI like birds. When I look at the little creatures, I would always feel the power of the nature.\\nToday I want to talk about sparrows because they’re almost everywhere and they are very\\nvigorous. Sometimes I can see them singing in the trees or picking food on the sidewalk in my\\ncity.\\nI like them because they make our life more colorful and they also have strong character that we\\ncan’t ignore.

That’s why I take this test.\\n\\n1a) Your Work\\nGeneral Description of Your Job\\n\\n\\nWhat job (or, what work) do you do?\\nI’m a teacher at an English training center. I’ve been working there for\\nseveral years. It’s my pleasure to see my students make progress, so I think\\nthis job is very suitable for me.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the nature of that work?\\nIt’s a teaching job. I help the students improve their English language skills\\nand most of them are planning to take IELTS.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you do in that job?\\nI teach English, both productive and receptive skills. My job is to help my\\nstudents succeed in their studies and pass exams if they need to.\\n\\n\\n\\nWould you say your job (or, your work) is very important?\\n\\n、\\n\\nI think so. I think the world will be much worse if there’re no teachers,\\nespecially good ones. I think my job is very important to the society.\\n\\n\\nHow do you think your subject will help you (or, benefit you) in the future?\\nI’m planning to be a teacher. Now I major in TESOL, which can help me\\nlearn teaching skills and I’m sure in the future I’ll be a qualified teacher\\nbecause of my educational background. However, experience is also\\nimportant, so I can’t stop learning even after I start working.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you think this subject has good prospects for the future?\\nTeachers are always needed in our society, so I’m sure I’ll be able to find a\\nsuitable job when I graduate.\\n3\\n\\nVisit our face: IELTS speaking and writing Corner\\n\\n\\f\\n\\nWhat benefits can people have if they do the jobs they like?\\nWell, there're many benefits. If people enjoy the jobs they do, they can be\\nmore productive and are more likely to succeed. When they do the jobs, they\\nalso won’t feel too much pressure but can enjoy themselves. It’s good for\\ntheir mental health as well.\\nFinding a Job\\n\\n\\nHow did you get that job?\\nI searched online and saw the job post. There were many chances for me to\\nchoose, so I submitted my resume online and got the interview and\\neverything.\\n\\n\\n\\nWas it easy to get that job?\\nOf course, it’s not easy, but I tried my best and because of my past working\\nexperience and professional training, I got this job.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs it easy (for other people in your country) to find work doing your job?\\nIt depends. For some people, if they graduated from some prestigious\\nschools with good majors, they can find jobs easily. Nowadays, a lot of\\ncompanies also pay attention to experience. Enough relevant working\\nexperience can help a person to be more competitive.\\n\\nFeelings about the Job\\n\\n\\nDo you like (or, enjoy) your job (or, your work)?\\nYes, I do. It provides me the ways to achieve my goals and help other people\\nsucceed. I’m sure I can learn a lot from my job.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich do you enjoy more, communicating with people at work, or the work\\nitself?\\nI enjoy the work itself. I think good communication is also important, but it\\nseems not matter much in our daily life. How to work better, in my opinion,\\nwould be more significant for me because my main purpose is to work not to\\nhave unnecessary conversations.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich is more important to you, co‐operating with others at work, or the\\nwork itself?\\nI like working with others because we can all contribute our efforts and\\nmake our goal easier to achieve. If I work by myself, I can probably\\norganize my own time and work better, but I won’t get feedback and support\\nfrom others.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":9.5}}"}}

Your Work or Your Studies.\\nQuestion 1. What job (or, what work) do you do?\\nAnswer 1. I’m a teacher at an English training center. I’ve been working there for several years. It’s my pleasure to see my students make progress, so I think this job is very suitable for me.\\nQuestion 2. What is the nature of that work?\\nAnswer 2. It’s a teaching job. I help the students improve their English language skills and most of them are planning to take IELTS.\\nQuestion 3. What do you do in that job?\\nAnswer 3. I teach English, both productive and receptive skills. My job is to help my students succeed in their studies and pass exams if they need to.\\nQuestion 4. Would you say your job (or, your work) is very important?\\nAnswer 4. 、  I think so. I think the world will be much worse if there’re no teachers, especially good ones. I think my job is very important to the society.\\nQuestion 5. How do you think your subject will help you (or, benefit you) in the future?\\nAnswer 5. I’m planning to be a teacher. Now I major in TESOL, which can help me learn teaching skills and I’m sure in the future I’ll be a qualified teacher because of my educational background. However, experience is also important, so I can’t stop learning even after I start working.\\nQuestion 6. What benefits can people have if they do the jobs they like?\\nAnswer 6. Well, there're many benefits. If people enjoy the jobs they do, they can be more productive and are more likely to succeed. When they do the jobs, they also won’t feel too much pressure but can enjoy themselves. It’s good for their mental health as well.\\nQuestion 7. How did you get that job?\\nAnswer 7. I searched online and saw the job post. There were many chances for me to choose, so I submitted my resume online and got the interview and everything.\\nQuestion 8. Is it easy (for other people in your country) to find work doing your job?\\nAnswer 8. It depends. For some people, if they graduated from some prestigious schools with good majors, they can find jobs easily. Nowadays, a lot of companies also pay attention to experience. Enough relevant working experience can help a person to be more competitive.\\nQuestion 9. Do you like (or, enjoy) your job (or, your work)?\\nAnswer 9. Yes, I do. It provides me the ways to achieve my goals and help other people succeed. I’m sure I can learn a lot from my job.\\nQuestion 10. Which do you enjoy more, communicating with people at work, or the work\\nAnswer 10. itself? I enjoy the work itself. I think good communication is also important, but it seems not matter much in our daily life. How to work better, in my opinion, would be more significant for me because my main purpose is to work not to have unnecessary conversations.\\nQuestion 11. Which is more important to you, co‐operating with others at work, or the\\nAnswer 11. work itself?\\nQuestion 12. Which is more important to you, the work you do or your colleagues (the\\nAnswer 12. people you work with/ your workmates)? It’s hard to say. I think they’re both important. For a lot of working class people, their social circle is made by the people they work with. Plus, I cannot work all by myself, so the good relationship with my colleagues can also help me do my job well.\\nQuestion 13. Do you like ______ (your subject)?\\nAnswer 13. Yes, I do. I’m really interested in economics and numbers and that’s why I chose accounting as my major. Also, this major can provide me with a stable job in the future. I think I’ll enjoy doing this job.\\nQuestion 14. Do you think it's important to choose a subject you are interested in? (Why?)\\nAnswer 14. I think so. If I’m not interested in something, it’s really hard for me to focus on it and I won’t be able to put all my effort into it. It’s said that interest is the best teacher and I really agree with that.\\nQuestion 15. What are your future work plans? (after you graduate)\\nAnswer 15. I want to find a big company and work in their finance department. I don’t mind being an assistant at first because I still need to learn a lot and gain experience.\\nQuestion 16. Do you think you will be able to easily find work in the future after studying\\nAnswer 16. _______ (your subject)? It’s hard to say. It might take me a few months to find the right job, but I definitely can have a bright career in the future, as long as I now start to lay a solid foundation for the knowledge and skills needed in that field.\\nQuestion 17. Do you enjoy studying that (your subject)? ‐‐What's the most enjoyable\\nAnswer 17. thing about it? I do. I think the most enjoyable thing is that I can connect all the things I study with my future career. I think the preparation process is enjoyable.\\nQuestion 18. (In a class,) who do you think is more important, the students or the teacher?\\nAnswer 18. They are both important. I think when students really want to learn, they can achieve their goals more easily; and of course, good teachers can make students learn more effectively.\\nQuestion 19. (In your class,) who do you think is more important, the students or the\\nAnswer 19. teacher? They are both important. I think when students really want to learn, they can achieve their goals easier; and of course, good teachers can make students learn more effectively.\\nQuestion 20. How should teachers teach?\\nAnswer 20. I believe teachers should apply fun and interesting methods to their teaching.\\nQuestion 21. Will children tell their parents when they face difficulties in their studies?\\nAnswer 21. It depends. For some children, they like sharing their feelings with their parents, they’ll let their parents know what they’re encountering. However,    for a lot of teenagers, they feel telling their parents their troubles and difficulties might make parents look down on them, so they’ll tend to keep all the problems to themselves.\\nQuestion 22. Do you think it’s good for teachers to praise the students when they do\\nAnswer 22. something good and point it out when they do something wrong? I think it’s the right way to do things; however, teachers shouldn’t praise the same student too much because they might get too proud of themselves and may not be able to keep doing what is good. Also, besides criticism, teachers should also encourage the students who do something wrong to help them to be better in the future.\\nQuestion 23. What types of schools have you been to?\\nAnswer 23. I was always in public schools when I was a child. The elementary school I went was pretty small and there were not many advanced facilities. I liked my middle school because it was big and the school would always have all kinds of activities for the students. When I went to high school, we spent most of our time studying, so I didn’t enjoy the time that much.\\nQuestion 24. Which school did you like the most? Will you send your children to that\\nAnswer 24. school?\\nQuestion 25. Do you like your major?\\nAnswer 25. Same to above.\\nQuestion 26. Who are more important, teachers or students?\\nAnswer 26. I think both. With the help from good teachers, students may learn more effectively. And on the other hand, with the hard work and the quick understanding of the knowledge by students themselves, the process of teaching and learning can go more smoothly.\\nQuestion 27. Who are more helpful, teachers or classmates?\\nAnswer 27. It’s hard to say. When students need help in the academic field, maybe teachers who could offer more professional help are more helpful, and while students need help in daily life, their classmates more be more helpful.\\nQuestion 28. Is your major popular in China?\\nAnswer 28. Yeah. You know, there’s an English department almost in every college. And almost every student, even in kindergarten, has started learning English.\\nQuestion 29. What’s the value of your major?\\nAnswer 29. I major in business, which, I think, is a very meaningful major. As we all know, in this fast developing society, we need businessman to help the products reach consumers so the world can develop in a balanced and healthy way.\\nQuestion 30. Is it difficult to learn your major?\\nAnswer 30. Well, nothing is easy to learn. My major involves a lot of math solving strategies and we have to do research both at the library and in the real world, which requires us read extensively. If I don’t have interest in this major, it’ll be very difficult for me to continue all the hard work.\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Your Work or Your Studies.\\nQuestion 1. What job (or, what work) do you do?\\nAnswer 1. I’m a teacher at an English training center. I’ve been working there for several years. It’s my pleasure to see my students make progress, so I think this job is very suitable for me.\\nQuestion 2. What is the nature of that work?\\nAnswer 2. It’s a teaching job. I help the students improve their English language skills and most of them are planning to take IELTS.\\nQuestion 3. What do you do in that job?\\nAnswer 3. I teach English, both productive and receptive skills. My job is to help my students succeed in their studies and pass exams if they need to.\\nQuestion 4. Would you say your job (or, your work) is very important?\\nAnswer 4. 、  I think so. I think the world will be much worse if there’re no teachers, especially good ones. I think my job is very important to the society.\\nQuestion 5. How do you think your subject will help you (or, benefit you) in the future?\\nAnswer 5. I’m planning to be a teacher. Now I major in TESOL, which can help me learn teaching skills and I’m sure in the future I’ll be a qualified teacher because of my educational background. However, experience is also important, so I can’t stop learning even after I start working.\\nQuestion 6. What benefits can people have if they do the jobs they like?\\nAnswer 6. Well, there're many benefits. If people enjoy the jobs they do, they can be more productive and are more likely to succeed. When they do the jobs, they also won’t feel too much pressure but can enjoy themselves. It’s good for their mental health as well.\\nQuestion 7. How did you get that job?\\nAnswer 7. I searched online and saw the job post. There were many chances for me to choose, so I submitted my resume online and got the interview and everything.\\nQuestion 8. Is it easy (for other people in your country) to find work doing your job?\\nAnswer 8. It depends. For some people, if they graduated from some prestigious schools with good majors, they can find jobs easily. Nowadays, a lot of companies also pay attention to experience. Enough relevant working experience can help a person to be more competitive.\\nQuestion 9. Do you like (or, enjoy) your job (or, your work)?\\nAnswer 9. Yes, I do. It provides me the ways to achieve my goals and help other people succeed. I’m sure I can learn a lot from my job.\\nQuestion 10. Which do you enjoy more, communicating with people at work, or the work itself?\\nAnswer 10. I enjoy the work itself. I think good communication is also important, but it seems not matter much in our daily life. How to work better, in my opinion, would be more significant for me because my main purpose is to work not to have unnecessary conversations.\\nQuestion 11. Which is more important to you, the work you do or your colleagues (the people you work with/ your workmates)?\\nAnswer 11. It’s hard to say. I think they’re both important. For a lot of working class people, their social circle is made by the people they work with. Plus, I cannot work all by myself, so the good relationship with my colleagues can also help me do my job well.\\nQuestion 12. Do you like ______ (your subject)?\\nAnswer 12. Yes, I do. I’m really interested in economics and numbers and that’s why I chose accounting as my major. Also, this major can provide me with a stable job in the future. I think I’ll enjoy doing this job.\\nQuestion 13. Do you think you will be able to easily find work in the future after studying _______ (your subject)?\\nAnswer 13. It’s hard to say. It might take me a few months to find the right job, but I definitely can have a bright career in the future, as long as I now start to lay a solid foundation for the knowledge and skills needed in that field.\\nQuestion 14. Do you enjoy studying that (your subject)? ‐‐What's the most enjoyable thing about it?\\nAnswer 14. I do. I think the most enjoyable thing is that I can connect all the things I study with my future career. I think the preparation process is enjoyable.\\nQuestion 15. (In a class,) who do you think is more important, the students or the teacher?\\nAnswer 15. They are both important. I think when students really want to learn, they can achieve their goals more easily; and of course, good teachers can make students learn more effectively.\\nQuestion 16. (In your class,) who do you think is more important, the students or the teacher?\\nAnswer 16. They are both important. I think when students really want to learn, they can achieve their goals easier; and of course, good teachers can make students learn more effectively.\\nQuestion 17. How should teachers teach?\\nAnswer 17. I believe teachers should apply fun and interesting methods to their teaching.\\nQuestion 18. Will children tell their parents when they face difficulties in their studies?\\nAnswer 18. It depends. For some children, they like sharing their feelings with their parents, they’ll let their parents know what they’re encountering. However,    for a lot of teenagers, they feel telling their parents their troubles and difficulties might make parents look down on them, so they’ll tend to keep all the problems to themselves.\\nQuestion 19. Do you think it’s good for teachers to praise the students when they do something good and point it out when they do something wrong?\\nAnswer 19. I think it’s the right way to do things; however, teachers shouldn’t praise the same student too much because they might get too proud of themselves and may not be able to keep doing what is good. Also, besides criticism, teachers should also encourage the students who do something wrong to help them to be better in the future.\\nQuestion 20. What types of schools have you been to?\\nAnswer 20. I was always in public schools when I was a child. The elementary school I went was pretty small and there were not many advanced facilities. I liked my middle school because it was big and the school would always have all kinds of activities for the students. When I went to high school, we spent most of our time studying, so I didn’t enjoy the time that much.\\nQuestion 21. Do you like your major?\\nAnswer 21. Same to above.\\nQuestion 22. Who are more important, teachers or students?\\nAnswer 22. I think both. With the help from good teachers, students may learn more effectively. And on the other hand, with the hard work and the quick understanding of the knowledge by students themselves, the process of teaching and learning can go more smoothly.\\nQuestion 23. Who are more helpful, teachers or classmates?\\nAnswer 23. It’s hard to say. When students need help in the academic field, maybe teachers who could offer more professional help are more helpful, and while students need help in daily life, their classmates more be more helpful.\\nQuestion 24. Is your major popular in China?\\nAnswer 24. Yeah. You know, there’s an English department almost in every college. And almost every student, even in kindergarten, has started learning English.\\nQuestion 25. What’s the value of your major?\\nAnswer 25. I major in business, which, I think, is a very meaningful major. As we all know, in this fast developing society, we need businessman to help the products reach consumers so the world can develop in a balanced and healthy way.\\nQuestion 26. Is it difficult to learn your major?\\nAnswer 26. Well, nothing is easy to learn. My major involves a lot of math solving strategies and we have to do research both at the library and in the real world, which requires us read extensively. If I don’t have interest in this major, it’ll be very difficult for me to continue all the hard work.\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}
