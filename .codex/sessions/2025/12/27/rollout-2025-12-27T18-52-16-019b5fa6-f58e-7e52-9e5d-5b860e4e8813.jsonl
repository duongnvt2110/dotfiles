Shared code such as Kafka clients, DTOs, and middleware belongs under `pkg` and `utils-service`, while `proto/` stores canonical protobuf definitions used across services. Documentation and architectural references live in `docs/` and the root diagrams (`architecture.excalidraw`, `archtecture.png`).\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nUse the root `Makefile` to coordinate environments: `make up` builds and starts every compose file under each service’s `build/` folder, and `make up-auth-service` (or any service name) runs just that stack for faster iteration. Tear everything down with `make down` or `make down-user-service`. When iterating on a single Go binary, run it directly (e.g., `go run ./auth-service/cmd`). gRPC stubs stay current by running `protoc --go_out --go-grpc_out ./proto/user.proto` (or `payment.proto`) exactly as shown in the README snippet.\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\nTarget Go 1.23.6 and keep modules tidy with `go mod tidy` when dependencies change. Run `gofmt -w` (or `go fmt ./...`) before committing; prefer snake_case for environment variables, UpperCamelCase for exported structs/interfaces, and lowerCamelCase for private members. HTTP handler files typically mirror the resource (`user_handler.go`, `booking_routes.go`) inside the relevant service’s `pkg` folder. Keep Kafka topics and event structs singular and suffixed with `Event` to match the saga documentation.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\nUnit tests should mirror the package path (e.g., `auth-service/pkg/token/token_test.go`) and follow the `TestXxx` naming that Go’s `testing` package requires. Run `go test ./...` at the repo root to verify all services, and use `go test ./booking-service/... -run TestBookingSaga` to target a specific workflow. Aim for meaningful coverage on domain packages (models, repositories, handlers) and mock Kafka or gRPC clients using `go test` table-driven cases.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\nExisting commits use short, imperative subjects (“update payment service”, “fix repo and usecase”); keep new messages under ~72 characters and describe what the change does, not how. Every pull request should link back to the relevant requirement or issue, summarize affected services, and include the commands used for validation (`go test ./...`, `make up-user-service`). Add screenshots or curl examples when touching HTTP contracts to ease verification.\n\n## Proto & Messaging Notes\nWhenever protobufs change, regenerate code before opening a PR and mention the affected services. Keep Kafka topic definitions synchronized with those in `README.md`, and document any new event type in both the README saga section and the service README under `docs/`.\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/duong/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/duong/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"baa4026728a1af8b89b6c7d8e53bb6dd9b959acb","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:duongnvt2110/ms-practice.git"}}}
