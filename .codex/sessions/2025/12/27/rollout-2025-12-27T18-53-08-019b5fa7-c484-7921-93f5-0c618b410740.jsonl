Shared code such as Kafka clients, DTOs, and middleware belongs under `pkg` and `utils-service`, while `proto/` stores canonical protobuf definitions used across services. Documentation and architectural references live in `docs/` and the root diagrams (`architecture.excalidraw`, `archtecture.png`).\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nUse the root `Makefile` to coordinate environments: `make up` builds and starts every compose file under each service’s `build/` folder, and `make up-auth-service` (or any service name) runs just that stack for faster iteration. Tear everything down with `make down` or `make down-user-service`. When iterating on a single Go binary, run it directly (e.g., `go run ./auth-service/cmd`). gRPC stubs stay current by running `protoc --go_out --go-grpc_out ./proto/user.proto` (or `payment.proto`) exactly as shown in the README snippet.\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\nTarget Go 1.23.6 and keep modules tidy with `go mod tidy` when dependencies change. Run `gofmt -w` (or `go fmt ./...`) before committing; prefer snake_case for environment variables, UpperCamelCase for exported structs/interfaces, and lowerCamelCase for private members. HTTP handler files typically mirror the resource (`user_handler.go`, `booking_routes.go`) inside the relevant service’s `pkg` folder. Keep Kafka topics and event structs singular and suffixed with `Event` to match the saga documentation.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\nUnit tests should mirror the package path (e.g., `auth-service/pkg/token/token_test.go`) and follow the `TestXxx` naming that Go’s `testing` package requires. Run `go test ./...` at the repo root to verify all services, and use `go test ./booking-service/... -run TestBookingSaga` to target a specific workflow. Aim for meaningful coverage on domain packages (models, repositories, handlers) and mock Kafka or gRPC clients using `go test` table-driven cases.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\nExisting commits use short, imperative subjects (“update payment service”, “fix repo and usecase”); keep new messages under ~72 characters and describe what the change does, not how. Every pull request should link back to the relevant requirement or issue, summarize affected services, and include the commands used for validation (`go test ./...`, `make up-user-service`). Add screenshots or curl examples when touching HTTP contracts to ease verification.\n\n## Proto & Messaging Notes\nWhenever protobufs change, regenerate code before opening a PR and mention the affected services. Keep Kafka topic definitions synchronized with those in `README.md`, and document any new event type in both the README saga section and the service README under `docs/`.\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/duong/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/duong/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"baa4026728a1af8b89b6c7d8e53bb6dd9b959acb","branch":"main","repository_url":"git@github.com:duongnvt2110/ms-practice.git"}}}

Analyze the requested prompt purpose and scope.\n2. Create a properly structured prompt file.\n3. Validate syntax, functionality and whether prompt is self-contained.\n\n## Prompt Creation Process\n\n### 1. Prompt Analysis\n\n- Understand the prompt's purpose and use cases for user input: $ARGUMENTS\n- Prompts should be put under ~/.codex/prompts/ with markdown format\n- Study similar existing prompts for consistent patterns\n- Determine and ask user to input more contexts. Since there is no parameter could be passed in later, the prompt itself should be self-contained.\n\n### 2. Structure Planning\n\n- Plan the prompt workflow step-by-step\n- Identify necessary tools and permissions\n- Consider error handling and edge cases\n\n### 3. prompt Implementation\n\nCreate prompt file with this structure:\n\n```markdown\n# prompt-name\n\nDetailed description of what this prompt does and when to use it.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Step-by-step instructions\n2. Clear workflow definition\n3. Error handling considerations\n\n## Examples:\n\n- Concrete usage examples\n\n## Notes:\n\n- Important considerations\n- Limitations or requirements\n```\n\nWhen arguments are required, select one of the following formats:\n\n- `$1` to `$9`: Positional arguments (those are always required)\n- `$ARGUMENTS`: All arguments joined by spaces\n\n### 4. Quality Assurance\n\n- Ensure invoking appropriate tools for workflow steps\n- Test prompt functionality conceptually\n- Review against best practices\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Keep prompts focused and single-purpose\n- Use descriptive names with hyphens (no underscores)\n- Include comprehensive documentation\n- Provide concrete usage examples\n- Follow existing prompt conventions\n- Consider user experience and error messages\n\n## Output\n\nWhen creating a prompt, always:\n\n1. Ask for clarification if the purpose is unclear\n2. Suggest appropriate contexts and tools to use\n3. Create the complete prompt file\n4. Explain the prompt structure and usage\n5. Highlight any special considerations\n"}}

Shared code such as Kafka clients, DTOs, and middleware belongs under `pkg` and `utils-service`, while `proto/` stores canonical protobuf definitions used across services. Documentation and architectural references live in `docs/` and the root diagrams (`architecture.excalidraw`, `archtecture.png`).\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\nUse the root `Makefile` to coordinate environments: `make up` builds and starts every compose file under each service’s `build/` folder, and `make up-auth-service` (or any service name) runs just that stack for faster iteration. Tear everything down with `make down` or `make down-user-service`. When iterating on a single Go binary, run it directly (e.g., `go run ./auth-service/cmd`). gRPC stubs stay current by running `protoc --go_out --go-grpc_out ./proto/user.proto` (or `payment.proto`) exactly as shown in the README snippet.\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\nTarget Go 1.23.6 and keep modules tidy with `go mod tidy` when dependencies change. Run `gofmt -w` (or `go fmt ./...`) before committing; prefer snake_case for environment variables, UpperCamelCase for exported structs/interfaces, and lowerCamelCase for private members. HTTP handler files typically mirror the resource (`user_handler.go`, `booking_routes.go`) inside the relevant service’s `pkg` folder. Keep Kafka topics and event structs singular and suffixed with `Event` to match the saga documentation.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\nUnit tests should mirror the package path (e.g., `auth-service/pkg/token/token_test.go`) and follow the `TestXxx` naming that Go’s `testing` package requires. Run `go test ./...` at the repo root to verify all services, and use `go test ./booking-service/... -run TestBookingSaga` to target a specific workflow. Aim for meaningful coverage on domain packages (models, repositories, handlers) and mock Kafka or gRPC clients using `go test` table-driven cases.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\nExisting commits use short, imperative subjects (“update payment service”, “fix repo and usecase”); keep new messages under ~72 characters and describe what the change does, not how. Every pull request should link back to the relevant requirement or issue, summarize affected services, and include the commands used for validation (`go test ./...`, `make up-user-service`). Add screenshots or curl examples when touching HTTP contracts to ease verification.\n\n## Proto & Messaging Notes\nWhenever protobufs change, regenerate code before opening a PR and mention the affected services. Keep Kafka topic definitions synchronized with those in `README.md`, and document any new event type in both the README saga section and the service README under `docs/`.\n"}}

(Future extension) Ticket and notification services can join the saga by consuming the payment events.\n\n### Event Types\n- Booking Service  \n  - `BookingOrdered`\n  - `BookingCancelled`\n- Payment Service  \n  - `PaymentSucceeded`\n  - `PaymentFailed`\n\n\n# Messeage Queue\n## Kafka \n### Topic \n| Topic Name | Message Type | Producer | Consumer | Description |\n| ---------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ----------- |\n| OrderEvent |              |          |          |             |\n#### Usecases \n#### CLI for creating and deleting topic \n#### Format payload mesage\n# gRPC command \n## Install \n### Setup protoc\n```\nhttps://protobuf.dev/installation/\n```\n### Setup golang binary\n```\ngo install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest\ngo install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest\n```\n### Command \n#### 1. user-service \n```\nprotoc --go_out=./proto/gen --go_opt=paths=source_relative \\\n    --go-grpc_out=./proto/gen --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \\\n    --proto_path=proto \\\n    ./proto/user.proto\n```\n#### 2. payment-service \n```\nprotoc --go_out=./proto/gen --go_opt=paths=source_relative \\\n    --go-grpc_out=./proto/gen --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \\\n    --proto_path=proto \\\n    ./proto/payment.proto\n```\n## Testing \n#### GRPC\nhttps://ghz.sh/ \nExample:\n```\nghz --insecure \\\n  --proto ./proto/user.proto \\\n  --call gen.UserService.TestGracefulShutdown \\\n  -c 1 -n 1 \\\n  0.0.0.0:50001\n```\n"}}

Shared code such as Kafka clients, DTOs, and middleware belongs under `pkg` and `utils-service`, while `proto/` stores canonical protobuf definitions used across services. Documentation and architectural references live in `docs/` and the root diagrams (`architecture.excalidraw`, `archtecture.png`).\n-\n-## Build, Test, and Development Commands\n-Use the root `Makefile` to coordinate environments: `make up` builds and starts every compose file under each service’s `build/` folder, and `make up-auth-service` (or any service name) runs just that stack for faster iteration. Tear everything down with `make down` or `make down-user-service`. When iterating on a single Go binary, run it directly (e.g., `go run ./auth-service/cmd`). gRPC stubs stay current by running `protoc --go_out --go-grpc_out ./proto/user.proto` (or `payment.proto`) exactly as shown in the README snippet.\n-\n-## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n-Target Go 1.23.6 and keep modules tidy with `go mod tidy` when dependencies change. Run `gofmt -w` (or `go fmt ./...`) before committing; prefer snake_case for environment variables, UpperCamelCase for exported structs/interfaces, and lowerCamelCase for private members. HTTP handler files typically mirror the resource (`user_handler.go`, `booking_routes.go`) inside the relevant service’s `pkg` folder. Keep Kafka topics and event structs singular and suffixed with `Event` to match the saga documentation.\n-\n-## Testing Guidelines\n-Unit tests should mirror the package path (e.g., `auth-service/pkg/token/token_test.go`) and follow the `TestXxx` naming that Go’s `testing` package requires. Run `go test ./...` at the repo root to verify all services, and use `go test ./booking-service/... -run TestBookingSaga` to target a specific workflow. Aim for meaningful coverage on domain packages (models, repositories, handlers) and mock Kafka or gRPC clients using `go test` table-driven cases.\n-\n-## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n-Existing commits use short, imperative subjects (“update payment service”, “fix repo and usecase”); keep new messages under ~72 characters and describe what the change does, not how. Every pull request should link back to the relevant requirement or issue, summarize affected services, and include the commands used for validation (`go test ./...`, `make up-user-service`). Add screenshots or curl examples when touching HTTP contracts to ease verification.\n-\n-## Proto & Messaging Notes\n-Whenever protobufs change, regenerate code before opening a PR and mention the affected services. Keep Kafka topic definitions synchronized with those in `README.md`, and document any new event type in both the README saga section and the service README under `docs/`.\n+# Repository Overview\n+- Multi-service Go 1.23.6 monorepo implementing a ticketing platform (README.md, docs/wrap.md).\n+- Services: `api-gateway-service` (routing), `auth-service` (JWT + refresh tokens), `user-service`, `ticket-service`, `booking-service`, `payment-service`, `event-service`, `noti-service`, and shared utilities (`pkg`, `utils-service`).\n+- Kafka-driven choreography saga: booking emits `BookingOrdered`, payment emits `PaymentSucceeded`/`PaymentFailed`, downstream services react (README.md, docs/wrap.md).\n+- Shared protobuf contracts in `proto/` and architectural diagrams in `architecture.excalidraw` / `archtecture.png`.\n+\n+# Quick Start\n+1. **Prepare env files** – copy `.template.env` to `.local.env` within each service you will run (e.g., `cp auth-service/build/.template.env auth-service/build/.local.env`).\n+2. **Launch dependencies** – `make up` starts every compose stack defined under `*/build/docker-compose.yaml`. Use `make up-auth-service` (replace suffix with service name) for faster iteration (Makefile).\n+3. **Inspect containers** – run `make status` to ensure containers are healthy before invoking services.\n+4. **Iterate on a service** – run `go run ./auth-service/cmd` (or the equivalent `./<service>/cmd`) for hot reload style development.\n+5. **Stop services** – `make down` stops all compose stacks; use `make down-auth-service` when targeting only one.\n+\n+# Common Commands\n+- **Build** – `go build ./...` at repo root ensures all modules compile under the single `go.mod`.\n+- **Test** – `go test ./...` for the whole repo; scope with `go test ./booking-service/... -run TestBookingSaga` when validating a single workflow (README.md).\n+- **Lint/Format** – `gofmt -w .` or `go fmt ./...` before committing; run `go mod tidy` after dependency changes to keep `go.mod`/`go.sum` clean.\n+- **Typecheck** – `go vet ./...` catches common issues; Go build/test already enforces basic type checks.\n+- **Migrations** – SQL lives under each service (e.g., `auth-service/db/migrations`). Apply them via your chosen DB tool before starting the related compose stack; no automatic runner is provided.\n+- **Infrastructure** – No Terraform/Helm here; Docker Compose is the only infra automation (`make up`, `make down`, `make restart`, `make logs-<service>`).\n+\n+# Repo Map\n+- `api-gateway-service/` – Echo-based gateway, build assets in `build/`.\n+- `auth-service/` – Auth HTTP API; `cmd/main.go`, DB schema in `db/migrations`, docs in `docs/`.\n+- `booking-service/`, `payment-service/`, `ticket-service/`, `user-service/`, `event-service/`, `noti-service/` – individual microservices following the same `cmd`/`pkg`/`build` layout; see each `docs/` folder for API notes.\n+- `utils-service/` – shared docker resources, compose file at `utils-service/docker-compose.yaml`.\n+- `pkg/` – shared Go packages (config loaders, Kafka helpers, HTTP middleware, JWT utilities).\n+- `proto/` – canonical `user.proto` and `payment.proto` plus generated code in `proto/gen`.\n+- `docs/` – requirements (`wrap.md`), Kafka references (`kafka.md`), monorepo notes (`monorepo.md`).\n+- `database/` – local MySQL data directory (only used by Docker); do not edit manually.\n+- `secret/` – OAuth client file; never commit changes or share publicly.\n+- `fe/` – placeholder for the frontend (package-lock.json tracks npm deps even if source is empty).\n+\n+# Architecture & Conventions\n+- **Layering** – Each service keeps transport code in `cmd/main.go`, handlers/use cases under `pkg/`, private helpers in `internal/`, and docker assets under `build/`. Shared types belong under `pkg/` (root) to avoid duplication.\n+- **Messaging & gRPC** – Update `proto/*.proto`, then regenerate via the README commands (e.g., `protoc --go_out=./proto/gen --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=./proto/gen --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative --proto_path=proto ./proto/user.proto`). Commit both the source and generated files.\n+- **Kafka topics** – Keep topic names singular and suffixed with `Event` per docs/wrap.md; update README & docs when introducing a new event.\n+- **Style** – Env vars snake_case, exported Go symbols UpperCamelCase, private symbols lowerCamelCase. Follow handler naming such as `user_handler.go`, `booking_routes.go`.\n+- **Commits/PRs** – Use short imperative messages (see `git log`); PRs should mention affected services and document validation commands (`go test ./...`, `make up-<service>`). Include HTTP samples or curl snippets when touching APIs.\n+\n+# CI/CD & Release\n+- There is no `.github/workflows` directory checked in; validation currently relies on local `go test ./...` plus targeted service smoke tests via Docker Compose.\n+- Deployment scripts are not versioned. Treat `make up`/`down` as the dev environment only. Production/staging promotion flows are undocumented—confirm with maintainers before shipping changes.\n+- When preparing releases, capture the saga events touched and ensure protobufs/Kafka contracts remain backwards compatible.\n+\n+# Safety & Guardrails\n+- Do not commit real secrets. Leave `.local.env` files untracked and use the templates (`*/build/.template.env`) for reference.\n+- Never edit `secret/` or `database/` contents manually; they are consumed by Docker containers and may corrupt local state if modified.\n+- Use `make down` instead of deleting containers/volumes manually. Avoid `docker system prune` outside the Makefile context because caches may be needed by other services.\n+- Before running migrations, back up local data; the SQL files are irreversible once applied.\n+- Document any commands you could not run (e.g., `go test`) inside PRs so reviewers know what to verify.\n+\n+# Open Questions\n+- No CI workflow or deployment automation is stored in the repo. Should we codify the expected pipelines/commands?\n+- Production/staging environments are not documented—confirm the canonical release process and environment parity requirements before making infra changes.\n*** End Patch"}}

Use `make up-auth-service` (replace suffix with service name) for faster iteration (Makefile).\n    10\t3. **Inspect containers** – run `make status` to ensure containers are healthy before invoking services.\n    11\t4. **Iterate on a service** – run `go run ./auth-service/cmd` (or the equivalent `./<service>/cmd`) for hot reload style development.\n    12\t5. **Stop services** – `make down` stops all compose stacks; use `make down-auth-service` when targeting only one.\n    13\t\n    14\t# Common Commands\n    15\t- **Build** – `go build ./...` at repo root ensures all modules compile under the single `go.mod`.\n    16\t- **Test** – `go test ./...` for the whole repo; scope with `go test ./booking-service/... -run TestBookingSaga` when validating a single workflow (README.md).\n    17\t- **Lint/Format** – `gofmt -w .` or `go fmt ./...` before committing; run `go mod tidy` after dependency changes to keep `go.mod`/`go.sum` clean.\n    18\t- **Typecheck** – `go vet ./...` catches common issues; Go build/test already enforces basic type checks.\n    19\t- **Migrations** – SQL lives under each service (e.g., `auth-service/db/migrations`). Apply them via your chosen DB tool before starting the related compose stack; no automatic runner is provided.\n    20\t- **Infrastructure** – No Terraform/Helm here; Docker Compose is the only infra automation (`make up`, `make down`, `make restart`, `make logs-<service>`).\n    21\t\n    22\t# Repo Map\n    23\t- `api-gateway-service/` – Echo-based gateway, build assets in `build/`.\n    24\t- `auth-service/` – Auth HTTP API; `cmd/main.go`, DB schema in `db/migrations`, docs in `docs/`.\n    25\t- `booking-service/`, `payment-service/`, `ticket-service/`, `user-service/`, `event-service/`, `noti-service/` – individual microservices following the same `cmd`/`pkg`/`build` layout; see each `docs/` folder for API notes.\n    26\t- `utils-service/` – shared docker resources, compose file at `utils-service/docker-compose.yaml`.\n    27\t- `pkg/` – shared Go packages (config loaders, Kafka helpers, HTTP middleware, JWT utilities).\n    28\t- `proto/` – canonical `user.proto` and `payment.proto` plus generated code in `proto/gen`.\n    29\t- `docs/` – requirements (`wrap.md`), Kafka references (`kafka.md`), monorepo notes (`monorepo.md`).\n    30\t- `database/` – local MySQL data directory (only used by Docker); do not edit manually.\n    31\t- `secret/` – OAuth client file; never commit changes or share publicly.\n    32\t- `fe/` – placeholder for the frontend (package-lock.json tracks npm deps even if source is empty).\n    33\t\n    34\t# Architecture & Conventions\n    35\t- **Layering** – Each service keeps transport code in `cmd/main.go`, handlers/use cases under `pkg/`, private helpers in `internal/`, and docker assets under `build/`. Shared types belong under `pkg/` (root) to avoid duplication.\n    36\t- **Messaging & gRPC** – Update `proto/*.proto`, then regenerate via the README commands (e.g., `protoc --go_out=./proto/gen --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=./proto/gen --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative --proto_path=proto ./proto/user.proto`). Commit both the source and generated files.\n    37\t- **Kafka topics** – Keep topic names singular and suffixed with `Event` per docs/wrap.md; update README & docs when introducing a new event.\n    38\t- **Style** – Env vars snake_case, exported Go symbols UpperCamelCase, private symbols lowerCamelCase. Follow handler naming such as `user_handler.go`, `booking_routes.go`.\n    39\t- **Commits/PRs** – Use short imperative messages (see `git log`); PRs should mention affected services and document validation commands (`go test ./...`, `make up-<service>`). Include HTTP samples or curl snippets when touching APIs.\n    40\t\n    41\t# CI/CD & Release\n    42\t- There is no `.github/workflows` directory checked in; validation currently relies on local `go test ./...` plus targeted service smoke tests via Docker Compose.\n    43\t- Deployment scripts are not versioned. Treat `make up`/`down` as the dev environment only. Production/staging promotion flows are undocumented—confirm with maintainers before shipping changes.\n    44\t- When preparing releases, capture the saga events touched and ensure protobufs/Kafka contracts remain backwards compatible.\n    45\t\n    46\t# Safety & Guardrails\n    47\t- Do not commit real secrets. Leave `.local.env` files untracked and use the templates (`*/build/.template.env`) for reference.\n    48\t- Never edit `secret/` or `database/` contents manually; they are consumed by Docker containers and may corrupt local state if modified.\n    49\t- Use `make down` instead of deleting containers/volumes manually. Avoid `docker system prune` outside the Makefile context because caches may be needed by other services.\n    50\t- Before running migrations, back up local data; the SQL files are irreversible once applied.\n    51\t- Document any commands you could not run (e.g., `go test`) inside PRs so reviewers know what to verify.\n    52\t\n    53\t# Open Questions\n    54\t- No CI workflow or deployment automation is stored in the repo. Should we codify the expected pipelines/commands?\n    55\t- Production/staging environments are not documented—confirm the canonical release process and environment parity requirements before making infra changes.\n"}}

Apply them via your chosen DB tool before starting the related compose stack; no automatic runner is provided.\n- **Infrastructure** – No Terraform/Helm here; Docker Compose is the only infra automation (`make up`, `make down`, `make restart`).\n- **Debug containers** – Tail logs via `make logs-<service>` and open a shell with `make exec-<service>` (Makefile targets).\n\n# Repo Map\n- `api-gateway-service/` – Echo-based gateway, build assets in `build/`.\n- `auth-service/` – Auth HTTP API; `cmd/main.go`, DB schema in `db/migrations`, docs in `docs/`.\n- `booking-service/`, `payment-service/`, `ticket-service/`, `user-service/`, `event-service/`, `noti-service/` – individual microservices following the same `cmd`/`pkg`/`build` layout; see each `docs/` folder for API notes.\n- `utils-service/` – shared docker resources, compose file at `utils-service/docker-compose.yaml`.\n- `pkg/` – shared Go packages (config loaders, Kafka helpers, HTTP middleware, JWT utilities).\n- `proto/` – canonical `user.proto` and `payment.proto` plus generated code in `proto/gen`.\n- `docs/` – requirements (`wrap.md`), Kafka references (`kafka.md`), monorepo notes (`monorepo.md`).\n- `database/` – local MySQL data directory (only used by Docker); do not edit manually.\n- `secret/` – OAuth client file; never commit changes or share publicly.\n- `fe/` – placeholder for the frontend (package-lock.json tracks npm deps even if source is empty).\n\n# Architecture & Conventions\n- **Layering** – Each service keeps transport code in `cmd/main.go`, handlers/use cases under `pkg/`, private helpers in `internal/`, and docker assets under `build/`. Shared types belong under `pkg/` (root) to avoid duplication.\n- **Messaging & gRPC** – Update `proto/*.proto`, then regenerate via the README commands (e.g., `protoc --go_out=./proto/gen --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=./proto/gen --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative --proto_path=proto ./proto/user.proto`). Commit both the source and generated files.\n- **Kafka topics** – Keep topic names singular and suffixed with `Event` per docs/wrap.md; update README & docs when introducing a new event.\n- **Style** – Env vars snake_case, exported Go symbols UpperCamelCase, private symbols lowerCamelCase. Follow handler naming such as `user_handler.go`, `booking_routes.go`.\n- **Commits/PRs** – Use short imperative messages (see `git log`); PRs should mention affected services and document validation commands (`go test ./...`, `make up-<service>`). Include HTTP samples or curl snippets when touching APIs.\n\n# CI/CD & Release\n- There is no `.github/workflows` directory checked in; validation currently relies on local `go test ./...` plus targeted service smoke tests via Docker Compose.\n- Deployment scripts are not versioned. Treat `make up`/`down` as the dev environment only. Production/staging promotion flows are undocumented—confirm with maintainers before shipping changes.\n- When preparing releases, capture the saga events touched and ensure protobufs/Kafka contracts remain backwards compatible.\n\n# Safety & Guardrails\n- Do not commit real secrets. Leave `.local.env` files untracked and use the templates (`*/build/.template.env`) for reference.\n- Never edit `secret/` or `database/` contents manually; they are consumed by Docker containers and may corrupt local state if modified.\n- Use `make down` instead of deleting containers/volumes manually. `make up` already runs `docker system prune`; avoid invoking it separately to keep cached images for other projects.\n- Before running migrations, back up local data; the SQL files are irreversible once applied.\n- Document any commands you could not run (e.g., `go test`) inside PRs so reviewers know what to verify.\n\n# Open Questions\n- No CI workflow or deployment automation is stored in the repo. Should we codify the expected pipelines/commands?\n- Production/staging environments are not documented—confirm the canonical release process and environment parity requirements before making infra changes.\n</final_instructions>"}]}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).\nmetadata:\n  short-description: Install curated skills from openai/skills or other repos\n---\n\n# Skill Installer\n\nHelps install skills. By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations.\n\nUse the helper scripts based on the task:\n- List curated skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do.\n- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.\n- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).\n\nInstall skills with the helper scripts.\n\n## Communication\n\nWhen listing curated skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request:\n\"\"\"\nSkills from {repo}:\n1. skill-1\n2. skill-2 (already installed)\n3. ...\nWhich ones would you like installed?\n\"\"\"\n\nAfter installing a skill, tell the user: \"Restart Codex to pick up new skills.\"\n\n## Scripts\n\nAll of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.\n\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py` (prints curated list with installed annotations)\n- `scripts/list-curated-skills.py --format json`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`\n- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`\n\n## Behavior and Options\n\n- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.\n- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.\n- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.\n- Installs into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills`).\n- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.\n- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated` via the GitHub API. If it is unavailable, explain the error and exit.\n- Private GitHub repos can be accessed via existing git credentials or optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for download.\n- Git fallback tries HTTPS first, then SSH.\n- The skills at https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.system are preinstalled, so no need to help users install those. If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.\n- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.\n\n</skill>"}]}}

Use when a user explicitly asks for a plan related to a coding task.\nmetadata:\n  short-description: Create a plan\n---\n\n# Create Plan\n\n## Goal\n\nTurn a user prompt into a **single, actionable plan** delivered in the final assistant message.\n\n## Minimal workflow\n\nThroughout the entire workflow, operate in read-only mode. Do not write or update files.\n\n1. **Scan context quickly**\n   - Read `README.md` and any obvious docs (`docs/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).\n   - Skim relevant files (the ones most likely touched).\n   - Identify constraints (language, frameworks, CI/test commands, deployment shape).\n\n2. **Ask follow-ups only if blocking**\n   - Ask **at most 1–2 questions**.\n   - Only ask if you cannot responsibly plan without the answer; prefer multiple-choice.\n   - If unsure but not blocked, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.\n\n3. **Create a plan using the template below**\n   - Start with **1 short paragraph** describing the intent and approach.\n   - Clearly call out what is **in scope** and what is **not in scope** in short.\n   - Then provide a **small checklist** of action items (default 6–10 items).\n      - Each checklist item should be a concrete action and, when helpful, mention files/commands.\n      - **Make items atomic and ordered**: discovery → changes → tests → rollout.\n      - **Verb-first**: “Add…”, “Refactor…”, “Verify…”, “Ship…”.\n   - Include at least one item for **tests/validation** and one for **edge cases/risk** when applicable.\n   - If there are unknowns, include a tiny **Open questions** section (max 3).\n\n4. **Do not preface the plan with meta explanations; output only the plan as per template**\n\n## Plan template (follow exactly)\n\n```markdown\n# Plan\n\n<1–3 sentences: what we’re doing, why, and the high-level approach.>\n\n## Scope\n- In:\n- Out:\n\n## Action items\n[ ] <Step 1>\n[ ] <Step 2>\n[ ] <Step 3>\n[ ] <Step 4>\n[ ] <Step 5>\n[ ] <Step 6>\n\n## Open questions\n- <Question 1>\n- <Question 2>\n- <Question 3>\n```\n\n## Checklist item guidance\nGood checklist items:\n- Point to likely files/modules: src/..., app/..., services/...\n- Name concrete validation: “Run npm test”, “Add unit tests for X”\n- Include safe rollout when relevant: feature flag, migration plan, rollback note\n\nAvoid:\n- Vague steps (“handle backend”, “do auth”)\n- Too many micro-steps\n- Writing code snippets (keep the plan implementation-agnostic)\n\n</skill>"}]}}

(Future extension) Ticket and notification services can join the saga by consuming the payment events.\n\n### Event Types\n- Booking Service  \n  - `BookingOrdered`\n  - `BookingCancelled`\n- Payment Service  \n  - `PaymentSucceeded`\n  - `PaymentFailed`\n\n\n# Messeage Queue\n## Kafka \n### Topic \n| Topic Name | Message Type | Producer | Consumer | Description |\n| ---------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ----------- |\n| OrderEvent |              |          |          |             |\n#### Usecases \n#### CLI for creating and deleting topic \n#### Format payload mesage\n# gRPC command \n## Install \n### Setup protoc\n```\nhttps://protobuf.dev/installation/\n```\n### Setup golang binary\n```\ngo install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest\ngo install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest\n```\n### Command \n#### 1. user-service \n```\nprotoc --go_out=./proto/gen --go_opt=paths=source_relative \\\n    --go-grpc_out=./proto/gen --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \\\n    --proto_path=proto \\\n    ./proto/user.proto\n```\n"}}
