Analyze the requested prompt purpose and scope.\n2. Create a properly structured prompt file.\n3. Validate syntax, functionality and whether prompt is self-contained.\n\n## Prompt Creation Process\n\n### 1. Prompt Analysis\n\n- Understand the prompt's purpose and use cases for user input: from my codebase could you review and write a prompts to know what the featues have implemented, and what is the features not.\n- Prompts should be put under ~/.codex/prompts/ with markdown format\n- Study similar existing prompts for consistent patterns\n- Determine and ask user to input more contexts. Since there is no parameter could be passed in later, the prompt itself should be self-contained.\n\n### 2. Structure Planning\n\n- Plan the prompt workflow step-by-step\n- Identify necessary tools and permissions\n- Consider error handling and edge cases\n\n### 3. prompt Implementation\n\nCreate prompt file with this structure:\n\n```markdown\n# prompt-name\n\nDetailed description of what this prompt does and when to use it.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Step-by-step instructions\n2. Clear workflow definition\n3.

Quality Assurance\n\n- Ensure invoking appropriate tools for workflow steps\n- Test prompt functionality conceptually\n- Review against best practices\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Keep prompts focused and single-purpose\n- Use descriptive names with hyphens (no underscores)\n- Include comprehensive documentation\n- Provide concrete usage examples\n- Follow existing prompt conventions\n- Consider user experience and error messages\n\n## Output\n\nWhen creating a prompt, always:\n\n1. Ask for clarification if the purpose is unclear\n2. Suggest appropriate contexts and tools to use\n3. Create the complete prompt file\n4. Explain the prompt structure and usage\n5. Highlight any special considerations\n"}

Clarify the scope: ask the user for the repository path, services of interest, target branch, and the canonical feature/requirement list (PRD, README checklist, tickets, etc.).\n2. Collect references: read the top-level README, docs/, architecture diagrams, service-specific READMEs, and any proto or saga specs that describe intended features.\n3. Inventory expected features by turning the requirement sources into a numbered list; note assumptions where requirements are implicit.\n4. For each feature, search the repo (prefer `rg`, `ls`, `grep`) for handlers, routes, proto messages, events, or tests that prove the feature exists; skim relevant files (cmd/, pkg/, docs/, proto/) to confirm behavior.\n5. Mark a feature as implemented only if there is clear code, documentation, or tests showing end-to-end coverage; capture file paths and short evidence snippets.\n6. Mark features as partially implemented if scaffolding exists but functionality, wiring, or tests are missing; describe gaps and the work remaining.\n7. Flag features as not implemented when no supporting code/docs are found; suggest likely locations or dependencies needed to build them.\n8. Summarize findings in three sections (Implemented, Partial, Missing) and include: evidence paths, confidence level, blockers/tests to run, and any cross-service considerations.\n9. Close with recommended next steps (e.g., `go test ./...`, `make up-service`, add docs) so the user can validate or continue implementation.\n\n## Examples:\n\n- \"Review ./booking-service against the saga spec in docs/booking.md and list which booking workflow features exist, which are incomplete, and what's missing.\"\n- \"Scan the entire repo to confirm which payment fraud detection features described in docs/payment.md are built, partially built, or absent.\"\n\n## Notes:\n\n- Always restate assumptions about requirements and repository scope before analysis.\n- Prefer evidence that includes file paths and line numbers so the user can verify quickly.\n- If requirements conflict or are unclear, pause and ask for clarification instead of guessing.\n- Mention any tests or commands you could not run so the user knows how to validate locally.\n"}
